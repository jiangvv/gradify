# gradify
A module to produce CSS gradients as placeholders for images.

[gradify showcase](http://gradifycss.com "gradify")

0.1 (beta)

The JS version was quickly written to use as an example on the website, and needs further work.
The python source also needs some optimization/styling, especially deep cross-browser support and PNG support.

# Getting Started

For a quick demo of gradify, simply place some images within the same directory and run:

`$ python gradify.py --demo --spread`

# Usage

To see the flags and their uses

`python gradify.py help`

`--demo`

DEMO (opt) - this flag will display the images next to their gradient on a webpage on completion.

`--spread`

SPREAD (opt) - this flag will give the color which has the least spread over the image the highest priority when assigning directions (opposed to most dominant color). This feature improves overall accuracy, however adds complexity and in unique cases it produces counter-intuitive results

`--single`

SINGLE (opt) - Only produce a single, uniform background color - this is much quicker and has all browser support

`-c --classname`

CLASSNAME (opt) - custom classname for the CSS rules to be assigned to (needs work)

`-f --file`

FILE (opt) specify a single image file to be used

`-d --dir`

DIR (opt) - specify a direcotry to be used. If not used (and not -f), current dir will be used. Only files with "jpg" extension will be used.

Other important notes:
There are constants you can tweak which will later be flags (Black/White sensitivity, image resolution, uniformness of colors) although generally the default vals are generally best.

My only suggestion is increasing the uniformness (by lowering it's val) can improve the general case, improve speed, but decrease the upper limits of accuracy. Increasing sensitivity to black will do the same.


# Requirements

gradify depends on Pillow, which you may install using
`pip install Pillow`

In case you get the error message `ImportError: No module named PIL`, you need to install Pillow first.
